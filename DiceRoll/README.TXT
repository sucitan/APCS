PROJECT TITLE: Roll of the Dice
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Learn how to use random numbers and arrays.
VERSION or DATE: 8/18/17
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
    Add code to the dieRolls method to roll TWO random, six-sided dice and return the sum of those rolls.
    The main method should take a number from the user and roll that many pairs of dice.
    An array should hold the count of each possible die roll sum. The possible sums are 2 through 12.
    Once the program is done rolling dice, it should display a graph such as the one below that shows relatively how many times each sum was rolled.
